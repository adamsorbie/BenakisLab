# Benakis Group Repository 

This repo contains scripts and analysis pipelines used for analysing 16S sequencing and metabolomic data in the Benakis Lab at the Insitute for Stroke and Dementia research LMU Munich. 

## Template for data analysis 

An Rmarkdown template for a typical 16S dataset analysis (alpha, beta-diversity, differential abundance and taxonomic composition) can be found [here](https://github.com/adamsorbie/microbiota_analysis_templates). You can install this template within Rstudio with: ```devtools::install_github("adamsorbie/microbiota_analysis_templates")```and once installed open by going to File -> New file -> R Markdown -> From template.
